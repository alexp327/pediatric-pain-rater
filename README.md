# WUSPI Shoulder Pain Rating Tool

This is a web application used to assist medical staff in assessing wheelchair users' pain using the WUSPI questionnaire. The form asks for patient info and ratings on 15 different activities, then neatly presents the data once submitted. This data is not saved or stored anywhere - it is lost once the user closes the tab or refreshes.

## Takeaways

This was an enjoyable, relatively easy project for me to first learn what building applications for a customer on my own is like. From a technical perspective, I learned about planning and building applications with the big picture in mind, in addition to specifics such as Angular, routing, components, and CSS/SCSS. After I completed development of the application, I also used this as a way to learn how to use Docker and containerize application to standardize the development process. From a non-technical perspective, I learned about communication with customers, gathering and understanding their requirements, and even time management.
